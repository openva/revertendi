# Revertendi

Virginia's cattle brand book, rendered as open data.

Most states publish "[brand books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_Book)," which list every cattle brand that is registered with the state's agriculture department. Virginia has [a cattle brand registration website](http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/animals/cattle.shtml) and [the register itself](http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/animals/pdf/cattlebrandregister041112.pdf), which is a twelve-page PDF, updated every five years. Under [2VAC5-80-70](http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/animals/pdf/cattlebrandregs.pdf), there is a prescribed namespace, allowing the alphabet, the numbers 2–9, and 9 separate symbols. Brands can be 2–3 symbols long.

This project seeks to render the 12-page PDF as machine-readable data and set up a website to search and browse that data.

The project is named for "[animus revertendi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animus_revertendi)," a Latin phrase meaning "with intent to return," and a legal concept that protects the ownership of free-ranging livestock.
